## Major Developments

### SIGTURK 2024 Workshop at ACL 2024

The most significant development of this year is the organization of our first workshop, SIGTURK 2024, scheduled to take place during ACL 2024. This two-day event represents an important milestone for our community and promises to be a hub for cutting-edge research in Turkic language processing.

Key highlights:

* Two-day workshop during ACL 2024
* More than 20 high-quality submissions received
* Platform for presenting state-of-the-art research in Turkic NLP
* Opportunity for networking and collaboration among researchers and practitioners

The overwhelming response to our call for papers, with over 20 submissions, demonstrates the growing interest and importance of Turkic languages in the NLP community. This workshop will set a new benchmark for research in this field and pave the way for future advancements.

### Enhancements to Core Guidelines

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our core guidelines, we continue to refine our principles, building upon the work of the past two years. This process includes examining information security aspects, promoting best practices languages such as Rust, and introducing quantitative metrics to evaluate and provide alternatives to potentially concerning libraries within the ecosystem. These enhancements will culminate in the first presentation of our core guidelines principles during the SIGTURK 2024 workshop.

## Communications and Infrastructure

To improve our outreach and streamline our operations, we have implemented several changes:

* Migrated our online presence to sigturk.com, providing a more professional and accessible platform for our community.
* Established contact at sigturk dot com as the single, reliable point of contact for all inquiries.
* Reduced the amount of data collected from members and participants, enhancing privacy protections.
* Transitioned to an opt-in communication model, respecting members' preferences for engagement.
* Shifted from an invitation-based calendar system to an observation-based one, promoting inclusivity and respecting members' and potential collaborators' autonomy in participating in SIGTURK activities.
